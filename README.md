# CSP implementations in C++

Here you can find some example implementations of the popular `SEND + MORE = MONEY` puzzle.

The `src/gt.cpp` file contains the source code for **generate & test algorithm** that solves SEND + MORE = MONEY. The enerate & test algorithm generates all the possible solutions one by one from the domain and checks wether the constraints are satisfied. If yes the prints the solutions, otherwise continues searching.
